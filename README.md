# Basic-blogging-website

I created this website just to gain basic understanding of the Python Flask framework. 

It is a locally hosted, blogging website that performs all the CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete).

It uses python libraries like sqlalchemy, that enables easy access to data obtained from html forms. The database used is sqlite, as it is light-sized and easy to get running. The SQLAlchemy library allows the usage of different databases, by just changing the location of the database, which ensures easy switching.
